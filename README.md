# Hangman_in_C

The Hangman game is a very simple guessing game in which the player must guess one letter(A-Z) at a time to complete the missing word given on the screen. 
The player/user is given a certain number of chances to guess the missing letters.
If the player is unable to guess the right letter, The Hangman game ends after a certain number of incorrect guesses, and the player loses. 
If the player correctly recognizes all the letters and completes the word, the game ends deeming the player as the winner.
The project is very fun and straightforward.
It is not too complicated and is clean for the players/users to navigate and play a fun game.
